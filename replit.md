# ClinicFlow OPD Management

## Overview
ClinicFlow is a React-based outpatient department (OPD) management application. It provides a queue management system for clinics with separate views for operators (registration) and doctors (consultation).

## Project Structure
- `App.tsx` - Main application component with state management
- `index.tsx` - React entry point
- `index.html` - HTML template
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration (port 5000, all hosts allowed)
- `components/` - React components:
  - `QueueColumn.tsx` - Queue display component
  - `PatientCard.tsx` - Individual patient card
  - `PatientForm.tsx` - Patient registration form
  - `DoctorConsultationForm.tsx` - Doctor consultation form
  - `ChatModal.tsx` - Chat modal for patient communication
  - `PatientReport.tsx` - Patient report with search and date range filters
- `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `constants.tsx` - Application constants and icons
- `server.js` - Express backend with PostgreSQL (required for full functionality)
- `database.sql` - PostgreSQL schema (legacy reference)
- `database_backup.sql` - Complete database backup with schema and sample data
- `LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step guide to run locally on Windows/Mac/Linux
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template for local setup

## Technology Stack
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite for development and build
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- localStorage for data persistence (works without backend)
- Optional: Node.js/Express backend with PostgreSQL (using Replit PostgreSQL)

## Running the Application
The frontend runs on port 5000 using Vite dev server. The backend runs on port 3001.
Uses `concurrently --kill-others` to manage both servers - ensures clean process termination on restart.

## Features
- Operator View: Patient/visitor registration
- Doctor View: Consultation management
- Queue Management: Waiting, OPD, and Completed columns
- Real-time chat between operator and doctor
- Database-backed design with localStorage fallback

## Stable Milestones (For Rollback Reference)
- **2026-01-30: "Q ClinicFlow Complete Version"**
  - Fully working OPD management system before Patient Lookup feature
  - All features from Version 1.00 to 1.15 are complete and tested
  - Use this checkpoint to restore if new development causes issues
  - To restore: Tell the assistant "Restore to Q ClinicFlow Complete Version"

## Database Structure
- **patient** table: Master patient data (id, name, age, gender, city, mobile, created_at)
  - Stores unique patient information for lookup by mobile number
  - Same mobile can have multiple patients (family members)
- **visits** table: Each clinic visit record
  - Contains patient_id (links to patient table)
  - Stores queue_id, name, age, gender, category, type, city, mobile, status, timestamps, notes, medicines
  - Each visit is a separate record even for returning patients
- **messages** table: Chat messages for patient communication
